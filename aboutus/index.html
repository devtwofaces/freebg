                    My name is Krishna Karuna Das. I live in Oakville, Ontario with my wife and two wonderful daughters. <br><br> Freebhagavadgita.ca  is my small endeavour to share the fascinating eastern philosophy, the greatest treasure for mankind, a gift from ancient Vedic times yet very much relevant and applicable for all ages. <br><br> Words fall short to express my gratitude to all those great saints, heroes and well-wishers who carefully protected this priceless treasure and passing on from generation to generation to bestow this profound wisdom that makes perfect sense. <br><br> One of my spiritual teachers once asked "who is a burden to society"? It's not someone who is 300 LB or 400 LB, but the one who is taking a lot from society and either not giving or giving back very little. This very statement made me think that I received a lot through Bhagavad Gita, its teachings, through those selfless holy teachers and from many people in this society who spent their precious time and energy in helping, moulding and training me all my life. <br><br> This deep thought manifested as a token of gratitude to give back to the society, this precious gift of Bhagavad Gita which is the "King of the Knowledge" so that people at large will be benefited in the same way that of my family and friends. <br><br> The practical implementation of the teachings of Bhagavad Gita helps one to live in peace, harmony, cooperation with all faiths, and be compassionate towards other living entities in this creation by sharing the Love of Almighty God with whomever one come across day in and day out. <br><br> I am affiliated with Iskcon Brampton, also known as Vedic Education Centre, located in Brampton.

                <p id="content">
                    The International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON), otherwise known as the Hare Krishna movement, includes five hundred major centers, temples and rural communities, nearly one hundred affiliated vegetarian restaurants, thousands of namahattas or local meeting groups, a wide variety of community projects, and millions of congregational members worldwide. Although less than fifty years on the global stage, ISKCON has expanded widely since its founding by His Divine Grace A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda in New York City in 1966. <br><br> ISKCON belongs to the Gaudiya-Vaishnava sampradāya, a monotheistic tradition within the Vedic or Hindu culture. Philosophically it is based on the Sanskrit texts Bhagavad-gītā and the Bhagavat Purana, or Srimad Bhagavatam. These are the historic texts of the devotional bhakti yoga tradition, which teaches that the ultimate goal for all living beings is to reawaken their love for God, or Lord Krishna, the “all-attractive one”. <br><br> God is known across the world by many names including Allah, Jehovah, Yahweh, Rama, etc. ISKCON devotees chant God’s names in the form of the maha-mantra, or the great prayer for deliverance: Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare/Hare Rama Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare. <br><br> Many leading academics have highlighted ISKCON’s authenticity. Diana Eck, Professor of Comparative Religion and Indian Studies at Harvard University, describes the movement as “a tradition that commands a respected place in the religious life of humankind.” In 1980s Dr. A. L. Basham, one of the world’s authorities on Indian history and culture, wrote of ISKCON that, “It arose out of next to nothing in less than twenty years and has become known all over the West. This, I feel, is a sign of the times and an important fact in the history of the Western world.” <br><br> ISKCON’s founder, Srila Prabhupada, has drawn appreciation from scholars and religious leaders alike for his remarkable achievement in presenting India’s Vaishnava spiritual culture in a relevant manner to contemporary Western and worldwide audiences.
