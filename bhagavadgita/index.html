                                                <li> This question has legged fellows offers from time in memorial and since man is a “thinking animal” he is not simply satisfied by trying to fulfill his basic needs. He asked many questions about his surroundings, his planet, his universe and about the mystery of his own existence - the mystery of who am I? </li>

                                                <li> Modern science deal with this vital question in vary mechanic  manner, stating that man is nothing but a combination of certain material elements, the smallest part of which are atoms or electrons, which constitute the origin of life. </li>
                                            </ul>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li> But, am I simply a bunch of atoms? Is this really life? Thankfully some thoughtful scientists are not so convinced.  Noble laureate Albert Szent-Gyorgyi commented, “In my search for life I ended up with atoms and electrons which have no life at all, and somewhere along the line, life has run out through my fingers.” </li>
                                            </ul>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li> And then, what is ‘death’? The law defines death as the “absence of life” but no clear understanding exists today on the exact nature of life.  How, then, would one define life?  Life is simply distinguished by certain symptoms and hence both “life” and “death” remain great puzzles. </li>

                                                            The gross body is, in ordinary terms, our physical body comprising earth (solid element), water (liquid element), fire (heat element), air (gas element) and ether (space element). Earth is the grossest element and ether is the most subtle.
                                                            The subtle body comprises mind, intelligence and false ego. These three elements cannot be directly perceived by any of our senses although they can be experienced.
